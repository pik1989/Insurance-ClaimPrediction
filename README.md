# Overview

The insurance companies are extremely interested in the prediction of the future. Accurate prediction gives a chance to reduce financial loss for the company.
The insurers use rather complex methodologies for this purpose. The major models are a decision tree, a random forest, a binary logistic regression, and a support vector machine. A great number of different variables are under analysis in this case. The algorithms involve detection of relations between claims, implementation of high dimensionality to reach all the levels, detection of the missing observations, etc. In this way, the individual customer's portfolio is made.

# Problem Statement

The insurance company is facing the issue of running out money when providing the claims. So please help the company by predicting the amount of money that will be required for a claim based on historical transactions. This will help the company to keep some reserve money for the future claims.

# Data

This is "Sample Insurance Claim Prediction Dataset" which based on "[Medical Cost Personal Datasets][1]" to update sample value on top.

# Solution

We are Predicting the Insurance Claim by each user, Machine Learning algorithms for Regression analysis are used and Data Visualization are also performed to support Analysis.
